title: Competition between Hershey's and Mar's. 

---

Born in 1857, Milton S. Hershey grew up in rural Pennsylvania in a Mennonite community. Though he only finished school up to the 4th grade, Hershey had a strong entrepreneurial spirit which he put forth in the candy business. Between his 20s and 30s, Hershey opened two separate candy businesses in Philadelphia and New York, both of which failed only after a short time. Moving back to Pennsylvania, Hershey decided to give it a third try, and opened the Lancaster Caramel Company, which eventually became a success ("Milton S. Hershey", 2013).

I want to make some changes for testing.
